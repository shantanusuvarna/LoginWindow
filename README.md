# Login System

## Description
This is a simple login system built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to enter their username and password, which are then validated against predefined credentials.

## Features
- Background image for aesthetic design
- Login frame with username and password fields
- Error handling for empty fields and incorrect credentials
- A "Forgot Password" button (not yet functional)
- User authentication with a message box for success or failure

## Requirements
To run this application, you need to have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

pip install pillow

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Place a background image at the specified path: D:/Python/PythonLoginSystem/Images/background.jpg
4. Run the Python script:

python login.py

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the username and password.
3. Click the "Login" button.
4. If the credentials match, a success message appears.
5. If incorrect, an error message is displayed.

## Default Credentials
- Username: Admin
- Password: Admin@1234

## Issues
- The "Forgot Password" button is currently non-functional.
- The hardcoded username and password should be replaced with a more secure authentication system.
- Incorrect username validation logic: != " Mrunal " should be != "Mrunal" (extra spaces need to be removed).
